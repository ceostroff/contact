I am a New York-based reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Get in touch if you have any story ideas or tips for us to follow up on.

If you are worried about authorities or the company you work for reading your messages, you should take precautions. Technology solutions are imperfect, but here are a few tactics for making contact:

## Chat Messengers

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You can add my mobile phone number to your contacts and I'll pop up as available. If you don't want to save my number, you can also send message through the system by typing my number into the search box and it will give you the option to click "New conversation with +19175810292". You can also save my contact under a fake name. 

Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, which can be sensitive information.

One shortcoming of Signal is that it's difficult to use without giving up your actual cell phone number. If you have an Android, you can find instructions on how to hide your true cell phone number here using Google Voice: https://theintercept.com/2017/09/28/signal-tutorial-second-phone-number/. 

WhatsApp and iMessage are ok for most things. I don't recommend Telegram, Threema or SMS text messages.

## Secure Drop
The Wall Street Journal has created a Secure Drop facility for people wanting to submit documents or send messages to our staff anonymously. Anything you provide via this system will be encrypted on a computer under our physical control and only decrypted on an offline computer disconnected to any network. The system is designed to help protect your anonymity, even from the Journal.

To use SecureDrop, you should follow these steps. For the best identity protection, we suggest you connect to the internet using a public Wi-Fi network.

Download and install the Tor browser here: https://www.torproject.org

Open the browser, wait for a connection, and then copy and paste this URL into the address bar: bi5wxtllt3jkz4bcvdmmw4euxjiteyo7xtkwp7rtxqlyyblsb2um7nyd.onion<br>

Once youâ€™ve done this, the system will give you further instructions and a code name, which you should remember or write on a piece of paper that you keep in a safe place. The Journal will only be able to contact you within SecureDrop via this anonymous code name.

More info can also be found <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tips">here</a>. 

## E-mail
You can send me an encrypted e-mail using PGP at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com. Encryption only protects the message itself, not the subject or the e-mail addresses of the people involved.

My key can be found here:

ProtonMail will also automatically encrypt emails: https://protonmail.com/. I can be reached there at ceostroff@protonmail.com.
