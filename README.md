I am a London-based reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Get in touch if you have any story ideas or tips for us to follow up on.

If you are worried about authorities or the company you work for reading your messages, you should take precautions. Technology solutions are imperfect, but here are a few tactics for making contact:

## Chat Messangers

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You can add my mobile phone number to your contacts and I'll pop up as available. If you don't want to save my number, you can also send message through the system by typing my number into the search box and it will give you the option to click "New conversation with +4407917315917."

Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, which can be sensitive information.

One shortcoming of Signal is that it's difficult to use without giving up your actual cell phone number. If you have an Android, you can find instructions on how to hide your true cell phone number here using Google Voice: https://theintercept.com/2017/09/28/signal-tutorial-second-phone-number/. You can also create a quick e-mail address that doesn't include your name anywhere through a service like ProtonMail: https://protonmail.com/. I can be reached there under my username, @ceostroff. 

Another app that allows for a similar arrangement is WickrMe, which has a few security features that some people prefer. Wickr: https://www.wickr.com/

WhatsApp is ok for most things, but it has weaknesses. I don't recommend Telegram, Threema or text messages.

## Secure Drop
The Wall Street Journal has created a Secure Drop facility for people wanting to submit documents or send messages to our staff anonymously. Anything you provide via this system will be encrypted on a computer under our physical control and only decrypted on an offline computer disconnected to any network. The system is designed to help protect your anonymity, even from the Journal.

To use SecureDrop, you should follow these steps. For the best identity protection, we suggest you connect to the internet using a public Wi-Fi network.

Download and install the Tor browser here: https://www.torproject.org

Open the browser, wait for a connection, and then copy and paste this URL into the address bar: p7exvfz35jydt25f.onion<br>

Once you’ve done this, the system will give you further instructions and a code name, which you should remember or write on a piece of paper that you keep in a safe place. The Journal will only be able to contact you within SecureDrop via this anonymous code name.

## E-mail
You can send me an encrypted e-mail using PGP at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com.

Encryption only protects the message itself, not the subject of the e-mail addresses of the people involved.
